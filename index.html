<h2>Info</h2>
<p>Hidden in the depths of Contstable country is the last place you would expect a web page to generate from.<br />
Stour Valley Designs is the exception.</p>

<h3>The Goal</h3>
<p>You might have seen clever promises of <abbr title="Search Engine Optimisation">SEO</abbr>, web2.0 or other buzz words that create images of cutting edge, trendy web sites. Sorry but there is none of that here.<br />
It is my goal to work with you at your level of experience and knowledge and provide you with a simple website that does exactly what you require.</p>

<h3>How We Get There</h3>
<p>There are a lot of technologies out there and the terminology behind them can be quite overwhelming, that is why I concentrate on listening to your requirements and not putting technology first.<br />
You will not find mountains of flashy animations and bloated content, I produce simple, effective and clean pages that are search engine friendly and written to the recognised standards of todays internet.</p>
<p>Nothing more, nothing less.</p>

<div class="section" id="about">
<h3>The Who</h3>
<p>My name is Adam Chamberlin, I have had an <a href="http://shibbyonline.co.uk" title="shibbyonline">online presence</a> for the last few years and it was about time I put some of my skills to better use.<br />
To which I offer myself and my toolset as a freelance coder and creator of web sites. I am no grahic designer, I know my way round Photoshop but I do not claim to be an expert. I can help with brand identity and image representation but if you want the full monty try some of the full time proffesional designers out there; I can recommend a few.</p>

<h3>The Why</h3>
<p>So I took a bite from the html apple when designing my first web site, and found it tasted good. However I learnt with tables and spacer.gif, some thing new was needed; symantic coding was introduced. So I went about re-teaching myself based upon <abbr title="Extensible HyperText Markup Language">xhtml</abbr> and <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr>, which is what creates web pages to the <a href="http://www.w3.org/" title="World Wide Web Consortium">W3C</a> standards; the approved mark of the internet.</p>

<h3>The When</h3>
<p>This is not my full time vocation, there is just not enough hours in the day to make it so, neither is there enough clients to start on your own.<br/>
So why bother?<br />
Good question, the answer is simple; why not. I would like to take what started as a hobby to the next level.</p>
